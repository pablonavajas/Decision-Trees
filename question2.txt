Question 2.1: (see train_full_tree.txt)
The first split rule is for Attribute 10 to be less than 3. 
It makes sense for this attribute to be the first split because the Information Gain by splitting the
dataset into two child datasets in this way is approximately 0.5 (it is 0.4309 to 4dp) - using this
split we are roughly reducing our overall "surprise" by half.

### Also comment on and discuss about any other split rules/attributes in the tree ###
TODO!!
