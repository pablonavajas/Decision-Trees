Question 1.1:
There are 16 "primitive" integer attributes (index starting from 0), each of which ranges from 0 to 15, and in the final column we have the gold standard label, which is a capital letter in the set {A, C, E, G, Q, O}.

Question 1.2:
The two main differences between train_sub.txt and train_full.txt are:

a) train_sub.txt is a subset of train_full.txt (it has only 600 rows against the full 3900 rows).

b) In train_full.txt the gold standard labels are evenly distributed with ~600 occurrences of each letter, however in train_sub.txt the distribution is skewed with C occurring 197 times and Q only 56.

Question 1.3:
Train_noisy:
A = 681
C = 571
E = 678
G = 622
Q = 682
O = 666

Train_full:
A = 667
C = 599
E = 659
G = 671
Q = 667
O = 637
